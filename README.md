linebot
=======

This is a simple line following robot using Arduino. It uses two servo motors and three light dependent resistors.

This project was done as part of the master programme in computer science at Malmö högskola, while introducing us to 
physical prototyping. It was also my first experience with the Arduino platform. The robot did quite well despite its 
simple design compared to the other groups' robots in the class.
